# seedsv2
updated version of my orignal.
MinecraftRandomSeedsV2
makes random minecraft seeds v1 using python the updated version that you can find on my github profile has a easyer to read version! if it has a + please remove it before using it if it has a - please leave it there if it has a +- before the numbers its a negative seed value but would be a good option for a positive seed value too
use a python shell/term to run the script
